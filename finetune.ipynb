    "## RAFT Finetuning using Azure AI MaaS Serverless\n",
    "\n",
    "This sample shows how use `text-classification` components from the `azureml` system registry to fine tune a model to detect emotions using emotion dataset. [Serverless compute](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-use-serverless-compute?view=azureml-api-2&tabs=python) is used to fine-tune the model. We then deploy the fine tuned model to an online endpoint for real time inference. The model is trained on tiny sample of the dataset with a small number of epochs to illustrate the fine tuning approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training data\n",
    "We will use the [emotion](https://huggingface.co/datasets/dair-ai/emotion) dataset.\n",

    "### Model\n",
    "This notebook is curated for `Llama` models for text-classification, Llama models are picked from `azureml-meta` registry. In this notebook we finetune with Llama-2-7b model, if you want to finetune with other variants like 13b or 70b, you can use this notebook with probably different SKUs.\n",

Alonger rope may allow for more preparation and momentum before performing tricks,[15] whereas ashorter rope may require less speed and height to travel between wakes.[15] In addition to this, thematerial of the rope being used can make a significant difference in ride experience.']], 'title': [['placeholder_title', 'placeholder_title', 'placeholder_title', 'placeholder_title']]}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

A few years later, a rope that was less stretchy was invented that gave the ridera more consistent pull on the rope, though they were heavier and larger in diameter. Modern ropes arecoated with Spectra and Dyneema, which decrease the stretch and drag of the rope.When wakeboarding, a wide variety of safety equipment is used.These include life vests or other buoyancy aids which preventwater-related injuries and deaths, as they keep the wearer buoyantuntil they are picked up. These vests especially help in situationswhere the rider is knocked unconscious or cannot tread water.[12]Furthermore, wakeboarders use water-resistant helmets that areable to ventilate water so that the helmets do not fill up withwater.[12] Even the length of a wakeboarder's rope is important inproviding safety; if the rope is too long, a wakeboarder will land onthe flat part of the wake instead of the downside, and their knees will buckle.Wakeboards themselves are also important to consider when preparing to ride. Four of the mostcommon wakeboard styles include the continuous rocker, the three-stage rocker, the five-stage rocker,and the hybrid rocker.[13] Rocker refers to the curve of the board from head to tail and each type ofboard has a different placement and amount of curve that works best for different types of rides.', 'Popular brands like Byerly,Hyperlight, O'Brien and Ronix provide ever evolving technology and equipment as well as qualityadvice for new and seasoned riders alike.', 'Most of these stem from the wakeboarderadjusting their posture, edge, and distribution of weight so as to fly into the air upon hitting thewake.[17] Various tricks include the toeside edge,[17] the heelside edge,[18] the ride switch,[19] and the180° spin.[20]More advanced tricks call for what is known as inversion or “inverts”.', 'A person wakeboarding in Zug, Switzerland\n",
       "WakeboardingWakeboarding is a water sport in which therider, standing on a wakeboard (a board with footbindings), is towed behind a motorboat across itswake and especially up off the crest in order toperform aerial maneuvers.[1] A hallmark ofwakeboarding is the attempted performance ofmidair tricks. Wakeboarding was developed from acombination of water skiing, snowboarding andsurfing techniques.The rider is usually towed by a rope behind a boat,but can also be towed by cable systems andwinches, and be pulled by other motorized vehicles like personal watercraft, cars, trucks, and all-terrain vehicles. The gear and wakeboard boat used are often personalized to each rider's liking.Though natural watercourses such as rivers, lakes and areas of open water are generally used inwakeboarding, it is possible to wakeboard in unconventional locations, such as flooded roads and carparks, using a car as the towing vehicle.[2][3][4]Wakeboarding is done for pleasure and competition, ranging from freestyle wakeboarding andwakeboard parks to wakeboard competitions at the X Games, WWA Wakeboard WorldChampionships, or similar events.[5] Though it had an obscure start, it is now the world's fastest-growing water sport.[6]The sport that would later become wake boarding began as water-skiing with mono water skis (singlewater skis) in the USA around 1950. The main difference between mono water skis and contemporarywake boards is the shape of the board and the stance.Wake surfing - using surfboards as mono water skis - began picking up traction around 1964, where itwas seen as an \"exciting new sport that's soon going to sweep the waterways.\"[7] Although surfboardswere originally used, boards without straps or bindings were first seen in New Zealand with boardscalled \"skurfboards\".']], 'title': [['placeholder_title', 'placeholder_title', 'placeholder_title', 'placeholder_title']]}   \n",

       "0  This does not necessarily mean the rider is fullyupside down, as evidenced by the Raley, a trick where the rider extends their body parallel to thewater bending at the knees to achieve inversion.[21] The heel side backflip, otherwise known as atantrum, is often regarded as the first and easiest invert to learn as an intermediate level rider. This isbecause the shape of the wake or the “kicker” (a type of floating ramp, used primarily at cable parks,that mimics the shape of a wake) naturally initiates the sequence of motions that are necessary tocomplete the trick.[22]There are many different ways that people are engaged in this sport.   \n",

This isbecause the shape of the wake or the “kicker” (a type of floating ramp, used primarily at cable parks,that mimics the shape of a wake) naturally initiates the sequence of motions that are necessary tocomplete the trick.[22]There are many different ways that people are engaged in this sport.</DOCUMENT>\\n<DOCUMENT>\"Wakeboarding on a ﬂooded road\" (https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-25665314).

Another part ofthe wakeboard itself to consider is the size of the board and the material, which are usually a wood orfoam core with a fiber glass or carbon fiber coating.[14][2] (https://www.saertex.com/en/services/references_overview/referenz/handmade-carbon-wakeboards#:~:text=HANDMADE%20CARBON%20WAKEBOARDS,fiber%20and%20a%20wooden%20core.)At the same time, the length of a wakeboarding rope will vary based on the rider's preferences. Alonger rope may allow for more preparation and momentum before performing tricks,[15] whereas ashorter rope may require less speed and height to travel between wakes.[15] In addition to this, thematerial of the rope being used can make a significant difference in ride experience.</DOCUMENT>\\nWhat is a heel side backflip also known as?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "1  <DOCUMENT>The latter soon grew in popularity, and a braided rope made out of polypropylene waseventually introduced. A few years later, a rope that was less stretchy was invented that gave the ridera more consistent pull on the rope, though they were heavier and larger in diameter. Modern ropes arecoated with Spectra and Dyneema, which decrease the stretch and drag of the rope.When wakeboarding, a wide variety of safety equipment is used.These include life vests or other buoyancy aids which preventwater-related injuries and deaths, as they keep the wearer buoyantuntil they are picked up. These vests especially help in situationswhere the rider is knocked unconscious or cannot tread water.[12]Furthermore, wakeboarders use water-resistant helmets that areable to ventilate water so that the helmets do not fill up withwater.[12] Even the length of a wakeboarder's rope is important inproviding safety; if the rope is too long, a wakeboarder will land onthe flat part of the wake instead of the downside, and their knees will buckle.Wakeboards themselves are also important to consider when preparing to ride. Four of the mostcommon wakeboard styles include the continuous rocker, the three-stage rocker, the five-stage rocker,and the hybrid rocker.[13] Rocker refers to the curve of the board from head to tail and each type ofboard has a different placement and amount of curve that works best for different types of rides.</DOCUMENT>\\n<DOCUMENT>Popular brands like Byerly,Hyperlight, O'Brien and Ronix provide ever evolving technology and equipment as well as qualityadvice for new and seasoned riders alike.</DOCUMENT>\\n<DOCUMENT>Most of these stem from the wakeboarderadjusting their posture, edge, and distribution of weight so as to fly into the air upon hitting thewake.[17] Various tricks include the toeside edge,[17] the heelside edge,[18] the ride switch,[19] and the180° spin.[20]More advanced tricks call for what is known as inversion or “inverts”.</DOCUMENT>\\n<DOCUMENT>A person wakeboarding in Zug, Switzerland\\nWakeboardingWakeboarding is a water sport in which therider, standing on a wakeboard (a board with footbindings), is towed behind a motorboat across itswake and especially up off the crest in order toperform aerial maneuvers.[1] A hallmark ofwakeboarding is the attempted performance ofmidair tricks. Wakeboarding was developed from acombination of water skiing, snowboarding andsurfing techniques.The rider is usually towed by a rope behind a boat,but can also be towed by cable systems andwinches, and be pulled by other motorized vehicles like personal watercraft, cars, trucks, and all-terrain vehicles. The gear and wakeboard boat used are often personalized to each rider's liking.Though natural watercourses such as rivers, lakes and areas of open water are generally used inwakeboarding, it is possible to wakeboard in unconventional locations, such as flooded roads and carparks, using a car as the towing vehicle.[2][3][4]Wakeboarding is done for pleasure and competition, ranging from freestyle wakeboarding andwakeboard parks to wakeboard competitions at the X Games, WWA Wakeboard WorldChampionships, or similar events.[5] Though it had an obscure start, it is now the world's fastest-growing water sport.[6]The sport that would later become wake boarding began as water-skiing with mono water skis (singlewater skis) in the USA around 1950. The main difference between mono water skis and contemporarywake boards is the shape of the board and the stance.Wake surfing - using surfboards as mono water skis - began picking up traction around 1964, where itwas seen as an \"exciting new sport that's soon going to sweep the waterways.\"[7] Although surfboardswere originally used, boards without straps or bindings were first seen in New Zealand with boardscalled \"skurfboards\".</DOCUMENT>\\nWhat is an advanced type of wakeboarding trick?

A few years later, a rope that was less stretchy was invented that gave the ridera more consistent pull on the rope, though they were heavier and larger in diameter. Modern ropes arecoated with Spectra and Dyneema, which decrease the stretch and drag of the rope.When wakeboarding, a wide variety of safety equipment is used.These include life vests or other buoyancy aids which preventwater-related injuries and deaths, as they keep the wearer buoyantuntil they are picked up. These vests especially help in situationswhere the rider is knocked unconscious or cannot tread water.[12]Furthermore, wakeboarders use water-resistant helmets that areable to ventilate water so that the helmets do not fill up withwater.[12] Even the length of a wakeboarder's rope is important inproviding safety; if the rope is too long, a wakeboarder will land onthe flat part of the wake instead of the downside, and their knees will buckle.Wakeboards themselves are also important to consider when preparing to ride. Four of the mostcommon wakeboard styles include the continuous rocker, the three-stage rocker, the five-stage rocker,and the hybrid rocker.[13] Rocker refers to the curve of the board from head to tail and each type ofboard has a different placement and amount of curve that works best for different types of rides.', 'Popular brands like Byerly,Hyperlight, O'Brien and Ronix provide ever evolving technology and equipment as well as qualityadvice for new and seasoned riders alike.', 'Most of these stem from the wakeboarderadjusting their posture, edge, and distribution of weight so as to fly into the air upon hitting thewake.[17] Various tricks include the toeside edge,[17] the heelside edge,[18] the ride switch,[19] and the180° spin.[20]More advanced tricks call for what is known as inversion or “inverts”.', 'A person wakeboarding in Zug, Switzerland\n",
       "WakeboardingWakeboarding is a water sport in which therider, standing on a wakeboard (a board with footbindings), is towed behind a motorboat across itswake and especially up off the crest in order toperform aerial maneuvers.[1] A hallmark ofwakeboarding is the attempted performance ofmidair tricks. Wakeboarding was developed from acombination of water skiing, snowboarding andsurfing techniques.The rider is usually towed by a rope behind a boat,but can also be towed by cable systems andwinches, and be pulled by other motorized vehicles like personal watercraft, cars, trucks, and all-terrain vehicles. The gear and wakeboard boat used are often personalized to each rider's liking.Though natural watercourses such as rivers, lakes and areas of open water are generally used inwakeboarding, it is possible to wakeboard in unconventional locations, such as flooded roads and carparks, using a car as the towing vehicle.[2][3][4]Wakeboarding is done for pleasure and competition, ranging from freestyle wakeboarding andwakeboard parks to wakeboard competitions at the X Games, WWA Wakeboard WorldChampionships, or similar events.[5] Though it had an obscure start, it is now the world's fastest-growing water sport.[6]The sport that would later become wake boarding began as water-skiing with mono water skis (singlewater skis) in the USA around 1950. The main difference between mono water skis and contemporarywake boards is the shape of the board and the stance.Wake surfing - using surfboards as mono water skis - began picking up traction around 1964, where itwas seen as an \"exciting new sport that's soon going to sweep the waterways.\"[7] Although surfboardswere originally used, boards without straps or bindings were first seen in New Zealand with boardscalled \"skurfboards\".']], 'title': [['placeholder_title', 'placeholder_title', 'placeholder_title', 'placeholder_title']]}   \n",

Modern ropes arecoated with Spectra and Dyneema, which decrease the stretch and drag of the rope.When wakeboarding, a wide variety of safety equipment is used.These include life vests or other buoyancy aids which preventwater-related injuries and deaths, as they keep the wearer buoyantuntil they are picked up. These vests especially help in situationswhere the rider is knocked unconscious or cannot tread water.[12]Furthermore, wakeboarders use water-resistant helmets that areable to ventilate water so that the helmets do not fill up withwater.[12] Even the length of a wakeboarder's rope is important inproviding safety; if the rope is too long, a wakeboarder will land onthe flat part of the wake instead of the downside, and their knees will buckle.Wakeboards themselves are also important to consider when preparing to ride. Four of the mostcommon wakeboard styles include the continuous rocker, the three-stage rocker, the five-stage rocker,and the hybrid rocker.[13] Rocker refers to the curve of the board from head to tail and each type ofboard has a different placement and amount of curve that works best for different types of rides.</DOCUMENT>\\n<DOCUMENT>Popular brands like Byerly,Hyperlight, O'Brien and Ronix provide ever evolving technology and equipment as well as qualityadvice for new and seasoned riders alike.</DOCUMENT>\\n<DOCUMENT>Most of these stem from the wakeboarderadjusting their posture, edge, and distribution of weight so as to fly into the air upon hitting thewake.[17] Various tricks include the toeside edge,[17] the heelside edge,[18] the ride switch,[19] and the180° spin.[20]More advanced tricks call for what is known as inversion or “inverts”.</DOCUMENT>\\n<DOCUMENT>A person wakeboarding in Zug, Switzerland\\nWakeboardingWakeboarding is a water sport in which therider, standing on a wakeboard (a board with footbindings), is towed behind a motorboat across itswake and especially up off the crest in order toperform aerial maneuvers.[1] A hallmark ofwakeboarding is the attempted performance ofmidair tricks. Wakeboarding was developed from acombination of water skiing, snowboarding andsurfing techniques.The rider is usually towed by a rope behind a boat,but can also be towed by cable systems andwinches, and be pulled by other motorized vehicles like personal watercraft, cars, trucks, and all-terrain vehicles. The gear and wakeboard boat used are often personalized to each rider's liking.Though natural watercourses such as rivers, lakes and areas of open water are generally used inwakeboarding, it is possible to wakeboard in unconventional locations, such as flooded roads and carparks, using a car as the towing vehicle.[2][3][4]Wakeboarding is done for pleasure and competition, ranging from freestyle wakeboarding andwakeboard parks to wakeboard competitions at the X Games, WWA Wakeboard WorldChampionships, or similar events.[5] Though it had an obscure start, it is now the world's fastest-growing water sport.[6]The sport that would later become wake boarding began as water-skiing with mono water skis (singlewater skis) in the USA around 1950. The main difference between mono water skis and contemporarywake boards is the shape of the board and the stance.Wake surfing - using surfboards as mono water skis - began picking up traction around 1964, where itwas seen as an \"exciting new sport that's soon going to sweep the waterways.\"[7] Although surfboardswere originally used, boards without straps or bindings were first seen in New Zealand with boardscalled \"skurfboards\".</DOCUMENT>\\nWhat is an advanced type of wakeboarding trick?
